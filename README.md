# 📸 Instagram Clone (Vue.js)

This project is a simplified **Instagram clone** built using **Vue.js**, created as a learning project.  
The main goal of this app was to **learn and practice Vue.js fundamentals**, such as:

- Component-based architecture  
- Dynamic routing  
- State management between parent and child components  
- Fetching and updating data through a mock API  
- Transitions and reactive UI behavior in Vue 3  

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Vue 3 + Vite** – main framework and build tool  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for modern, responsive styling  
- **Vue Router** – for page navigation (`/story/:id`)  
- **json-server** – to simulate a backend using a local database (`db.json`)  
- **Font Awesome** – for icons

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built **for learning purposes** — to explore Vue.js concepts through a practical, fun example.  
It’s not meant to be a full Instagram clone, but rather a personal exercise in **component design**, **routing** and **data handling** in Vue 3.
